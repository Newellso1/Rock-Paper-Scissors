# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is the first Javascript project set by the Odin Challenge.

I tried to give it my own little twist by adding the round and score counters so I could display a message at the end stating who the victor was along with final scores...I am aware that this will probably have to be scrapped in order to complete the later Odin Challenge project but hey ho.
